description: This article explains how to write a custom ROP chain to bypass Data
  Execution Prevention (DEP) on a Windows 10 system. DEP makes certain parts of memory
  non-executable, and the main goal is to use a ROP chain to combine several ROP gadgets
  together to bypass DEP and execute code on the stack.
